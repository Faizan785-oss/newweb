        <p class="text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, 
            such as public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails
            unstructured learning through daily experiences.
            Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on teaching methods, such as teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on subjects, such as science education, language education, and physical education. Additionally, the term "education" can denote the mental states and
            qualities of educated individuals and the academic field studying educational phenomena.</p>

        <p class="text-small">The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are disagreements about the aims of education and the extent to which education differs from indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements impact how to identify,
             measure, and enhance various forms of education. Essentially, education socializes children into society by instilling cultural values and norms, equipping them with the skills necessary to become productive members of society. In doing so,
            it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions play a significant role in education. For instance,
            governments establish education policies to determine the timing of school classes, the curriculum, and attendance requirements. International organizations,
            such as UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children.
            Many factors influence the success of education.rimary education for all children.

        <p class="text-small">The term "education" originates from the Latin words educare, meaning "to bring up," and educere, meaning 
            "to bring forth." The definition of education has been explored by theorists from various fields.
             Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving goals like the transmission
            of knowledge, skills, and character traits.However, extensive debate surrounds its precise nature
            beyond these general features. One approach views education as a process occurring during events such
            as schooling, teaching, and learning. Another perspective perceives education not as a process but 
            as the mental states and dispositions of educated individuals resulting from this process.
            Furthermore, the term may also refer to the academic field that studies the methods, processes,
            and social institutions involved in teaching and learning.Having a clear understanding of the term 
            is crucial when attempting to identify educational phenomena, measure educational success, and improve educational practices.
